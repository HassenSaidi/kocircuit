# INSTALLING KO

To run Ko, you need an installation of the Go language toolchain.

Make sure that your `GOPATH` environment variable is set.
(The Ko language uses a packaging system intentionally aligned with
Go's packaging system: It assumes that the repo of `.ko` source files and
package directories is rooted at `GOPATH/src`.

The Ko interpreter can be installed using `go get`:

	go get -u github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lang/ko

To make sure your setup succeeded, try running:

	ko play github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/codelab/HelloWorld
