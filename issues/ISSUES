CI
* travis integration with ko tests

LANG
* extend Less to work on strings
* extend arithmetic functions to work on floats
* should "()" return an empty structure? should empty structure not be equivalent to empty?
* Range with argument:
	* rename to step
	* pass carry-and-elem to a default argument of step (for consistency with other macros)
* Memoize macro

PROTO
* proto service integration

DOC
* programming patterns (tests, etc)
* circuit assembly level (Circuit IR)
* svg illustrations for Range and Loop
* protobuf integration doc

INSTRUMENTATION
* recursive profiling aggregated in step effects, carrying:
	unification cost, deconstruction cost, integration cost,
	# varieties invoked = # gates invoked + # circuits invoked + # macros invoked
