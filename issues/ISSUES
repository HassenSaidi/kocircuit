CI
* go 1.10 compliance
* travis integration with ko tests

LANG
* accept left/right calling convention in arithmetic macros
* extend Less, Sum to work on strings
* extend arithmetic functions to work on floats

* disallow user functions named after macros (Panic, Range, etc)

INSTRUMENTATION
* recursive profiling aggregated in step effects, carrying:
	unification cost, deconstruction cost, integration cost,
	# varieties invoked = # gates invoked + # circuits invoked + # macros invoked
